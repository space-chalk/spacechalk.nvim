# ðŸ›¸ Space Chalk Theme for NeoVim ðŸŽ¨
A theme trying to combine a love of neon space colors and pastel chalk board colors.

<img src="./img/nvim_example.png" style="width=800" alt="Screenshot of neovim editing a python file. It's showing off the Space Chalk Color Theme, featuring syntax highlight colors somewhere between pastel and neon on a very dark bluish purple background">

## Supported features

- [barbar] - tabline
- [barbecue] - referenceline
- [gitsigns] - git column
- [scrollbar.nvim] - scrollbar
- [telescope] - file browser, currently working on this
- [nvim-treesitter] - syntax highlighter, currently working on this


## Installation

You should be able to install this fine with any neovim plugin manager. (If you can't, let me know via an Issue or PR)

### packer

```lua
use {'space-chalk/spacechalk.nvim'}
```

## Setup
You can of course use vimscript instead of lua, but for those new to neovim, this is what you want to do:

```lua
-- you will want this after packer has been loaded
vim.cmd.colorscheme("spacechalk")
```

### tmux
If you are running neovim inside tmux:

```tmux
set-option -g default-terminal "xterm-256color"
set-option -ga terminal-overrides ',xterm-256color:Tc'
```

## Contributing and Troubleshooting

Note: this plugin is currently written in vimscript, but there are plans to convert to lua in the near future!

Contributions to get the syntax highlighting working everywhere are absolutely
welcome. If you're new to vim colorschemes, here's some tips!

To see hex colors highlighted in neovim, I recommend installing [nvim-colorizer.lua].

### Get the current highlighting for a given variable/filetype
If you're already in a file in vim, and the highlighting doesn't look quite right,
but you're not sure what the variable is called, you can run the following command:

```vim
:highlight
```

That will give the exact `highlight` commands for all the variables, but unfortunately it's not searchable, so you'll have to page through it ;(

If you know the variable you want to check though, you can do the following

```vim
" gets the current highlight for just the Function highlight group
:highlight Function
```

It may also be helpful to check out more about syntax/colors with:

```vim
:help syntax
```

If you're using [nvim-treesitter], I _highly_ recommend installing [nvim-treesitter/playground], as it can be really helpful for debugging a treesitter highlighting issue. Once installed, you can run the following to get the current highlight group under your cursor:

```vim
:TSHighlightCapturesUnderCursor
```

Finally, [vivify]'s a useful tool for learning what highlight variables are called.
